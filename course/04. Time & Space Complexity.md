# Definition
* Time Complexity = Time Complexity is the number of operations an algorithm performs to complete its task (considering that each operation takes the same amount of time)
* Time Complexity = Time Complexity is the measure of how the running time of an algorithm increases with the size of input data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
# To Read
* The time complexity, measured in the number of comparisons, then becomes T(n) = n - 1
* Time Complexity depends on input size & no of comparisions 
* O(1) < O(logn) < O(n) < O(nlogn)

# Time Complexity
1. 𝐎(1) - 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞
- The runtime doesn't change regardless of the input size.
- Example: Accessing an element in an array by its index.

2. 𝐎(𝐥𝐨𝐠 𝐧) - 𝐋𝐨𝐠𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐦𝐢𝐜 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞
- The runtime grows slowly as the input size increases. Typically seen in algorithms that divide the problem in half with each step.
- Example: Binary search in a sorted array.

3. 𝐎(𝐧) - 𝐋𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐚𝐫 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞
- The runtime grows linearly with the input size.
- Example: Finding an element in an array by iterating through each element.

4. 𝐎(𝐧 𝐥𝐨𝐠 𝐧) - 𝐋𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐦𝐢𝐜 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞
- The runtime grows slightly faster than linear time. It involves a logarithmic number of operations for each element in the input.
- Example: Sorting an array using quick sort or merge sort.

5. 𝐎(𝐧^2) - 𝐐𝐮𝐚𝐝𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞
- The runtime grows proportionally to the square of the input size.
- Example: Bubble sort algorithm which compares and potentially swaps every pair of elements.

6. 𝐎(2^𝐧) - 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞
- The runtime doubles with each addition to the input. These algorithms become impractical for larger input sizes.
- Example: Generating all subsets of a set.

7. 𝐎(𝐧!) - 𝐅𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞
- Runtime is proportional to the factorial of the input size.
- Example: Generating all permutations of a set.
