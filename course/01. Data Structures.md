# Definition
* Data Structure = It is a way of organizing the data so that it can be used efficiently

# Terminology

# To Read
* Data structures can also be classified as Static data structure & Dynamic data structure
* Static data structure = It is a type of data structure where the size is allocated at the compile time. Therefore, the maximum size is fixed
* Dynamic data structure = It is a type of data structure where the size is allocated at the run time. Therefore, the maximum size is flexible

# Types of Data Structures
1. Primitive data structure
2. Non-primitive data structure

* The primitive data structures are primitive data types. The int, char, float, double, and pointer are the primitive data structures that can hold a single value
* Non-Primitive Data structure = Linear data structure & Non-linear data structure
* Approach depends on Operation
