# Definition
* A brute force algorithm is a straightforward approach to solving a problem by systematically exploring all possible solutions.
* It does not rely on any heuristics or optimizationsâ€”it tries every combination or possibility until the desired solution is found. 
* Brute force is easy to implement and understand but is often inefficient for problems with a large solution space due to its high computational cost.

# Key Characteristics
1. Exhaustive Search: Tries every possible solution.
2. Simplicity: Easy to design and implement.
3. Inefficient: Often has high time complexity (e.g.,O(n^2), O(2^n)or worse)
4. Guaranteed Solution: Always finds a solution if one exists.

# Where Can Brute Force Algorithms Be Used?
1. In Small Problem Spaces: Where the number of possible solutions is limited.
2. For Learning Purposes: As a baseline for more advanced algorithms.
3. In Cryptography: To attempt breaking passwords or decrypting data by testing all possible keys.
4. Pattern Matching: To search for substrings or patterns in text.
5. Optimization Problems: To find the best solution by trying all possibilities.
6. Combinatorial Problems: Such as generating permutations, combinations, or subsets.
