# Queue Types and Implementations in Java
|SNo| #Queue Type  |#Java Class| #Description |
| :---| :--- | :--- | :--- | 
|1 | Simple Queue |LinkedList |FIFO queue with dynamic size |
|2 | Double-Ended Queue |ArrayDeque |Allows insertion/removal from both ends. |
|3 | Priority Queue |PriorityQueue |Orders elements by natural ordering or custom comparator. |
|4 | Blocking Queue |LinkedBlockingQueue |Thread-safe queue with blocking operations. |
|5 | Concurrent Queue |ConcurrentLinkedQueue |Thread-safe, non-blocking queue for high-concurrency environments. |
|6 | Fixed-Size Queue |ArrayBlockingQueue |Bounded blocking queue with fixed capacity. |
