# Algorithms
* Algorithm Complexity
* Time complexity
* Space complexity = Auxiliary space + Input size
* Operations = Searching,Sorting,Insertion,Updation,Deletion
# Types of Algorithms
* Search Algorithm
* Sort Algorithm
# Asymptotic Notations
1. Big oh Notation (O) --- ( Worst case )
2. Omega Notation (Ω) --- ( Average case )
3. Theta Notation (θ) --- ( Best case )
* Asymptotic Notations will be used to represent Time Complexity & Space Complexity of an Alogrithm
* Worst case --- It defines the input for which the algorithm takes a huge time.
* Average case --- It takes average time for the program execution.
* Best case --- It defines the input for which the algorithm takes the lowest time
* We need algorithms because of the Scalability and Performance
