# Algorithms
* Algorithm Complexity
* Time complexity
* Space complexity = Auxiliary space + Input size
* Operations = Searching,Sorting,Insertion,Updation,Deletion
# Types of Algorithms
* Search Algorithm
* Sort Algorithm
# Asymptotic Notations
* Big oh Notation (?) --- ( Worst case )
* Omega Notation (Ω) --- ( Average case )
* Theta Notation (θ) --- ( Best case )
* Worst case --- It defines the input for which the algorithm takes a huge time.
* Average case --- It takes average time for the program execution.
* Best case --- It defines the input for which the algorithm takes the lowest time
